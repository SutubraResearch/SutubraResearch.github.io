# Site Feedback — Round 2

The structure and design are good. The bio section is the strongest part — don't touch it. These are the changes needed.

---

## 1. Hero headline — too long, reads like a list

"Sutubra Research is an energy system modeling practice that works with utilities, grid operators, government agencies, developers, investors, and research institutions across North America."

That's five lines of large text. The client list is accurate but reading it feels like a roll call. Find a way to convey the same breadth without enumerating every client type. Something tighter that communicates "works across the energy sector" — the specific client types can land elsewhere (the bio already covers this).

The subtext — "Founded by Cameron Wade, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Cameron is also a Principal at Evolved Energy Research." — also reads awkwardly. Two sentences, both starting with Cameron's name or a reference to him. The dual role and location need to be there, but the phrasing needs work.

---

## 2. "What Sutubra Does" framing paragraph — update for 2026

"North America's electricity system is being replanned — driven by returning load growth, clean energy mandates, and a climate that's shifting faster than planning cycles were designed for."

This is accurate but it's a 2023 framing. In 2026 the pressure has broadened: affordability is now a dominant concern, energy security is back on the agenda, firming variable renewables is an unsolved problem at scale, and fuel security matters alongside decarbonization. The planning challenge isn't just "more renewables, more electrification" — it's navigating all of these pressures simultaneously, often in tension with each other. Update the framing to reflect the current landscape without losing the core point that planning is getting harder.

---

## 3. System Planning card — close but not quite landing

The concept is right. The MGA framing (near-cost-optimal alternatives, Nature Communications reference) works well. But the card as written doesn't fully cohere — the connection between "what to build over the next two to three decades" and the MGA approach could be tighter. Make sure a reader who doesn't know energy modeling still understands why generating hundreds of alternatives matters (it's about finding what's robust across uncertainty, not just what's cheapest under one set of assumptions).

---

## 4. Forecasting & Reliability — too narrow

The card overindexes on peak load forecasting. That's an important part of what Cameron does, but forecasting is broader: load shape forecasting, energy forecasting, demand driver analysis (how data centers, electrification, and distributed generation are changing consumption patterns), and resource adequacy assessment. Peak load forecasting using extreme value theory is a specific strength worth featuring, but it shouldn't be the entire card. Reframe as the broader forecasting and reliability capability, with peak load as a highlighted example.

---

## 5. Energy Transition card — needs stronger framing

The current text is improved but still somewhat generic. The real insight is that the hardest planning questions live at the boundaries between sectors — and getting them wrong is expensive. When buildings electrify, it reshapes electricity demand curves. When you choose between heat pumps, natural gas, and hybrid systems, the answer depends on electric system costs, gas system cost recovery, and household economics simultaneously. You can't model these in isolation.

Cameron has direct expertise here: he's co-authored a paper in *Environmental Research Letters* (Smillie, Vaishnav, Wade et al., 2024) examining exactly this — hybrid heat pumps vs. full electrification in cold climates, using a least-cost optimization across household, electric, and gas system costs. The finding: fully electrifying peak heating loads carries extreme marginal abatement costs compared to hybrid approaches. This is the kind of cross-sector, cross-fuel analysis that only works when you model the systems together.

The card should convey that Sutubra has the sector-coupled modeling expertise to handle these interconnected questions — and cite the paper as evidence. This is a differentiator. Most consultants work within a single sector.

## 6. Distributed Energy & Storage — rename and sharpen

"Distributed Energy & Storage" is an awkward name. This is behind-the-meter modeling. The content is mostly right but the scope is slightly broader than described: it includes operational optimization (dispatch, scheduling) but also target setting for clean energy companies — what's achievable, what it costs, what the realistic timeline looks like. Make sure both dimensions come through.

---

## 7. Remove EMH Forum from Talks & Media

It's still there: "Speaker — EMH Forum on ensemble energy modeling." Drop it. Replace the specific conference listings with a general note that Cameron speaks regularly at industry and academic conferences, and feature New York Climate Week as the named example.

---

## 8. Open-Source Models section — remove it

Remove the "Open-Source Models" subsection from the Engagement area. The open-source contributions (ACES, Temoa) are already referenced elsewhere on the site — they don't need their own section in the engagement list.

---

## 9. Add the hybrid heating paper to Selected Publications

Add: Smillie, S., Vaishnav, P., Wade, C., et al. (2024). "Hybrid heat pumps avoid extreme marginal abatement costs of electrifying peak heating loads in cold regions." *Environmental Research Letters*.

## What NOT to change

- **Bio** — it's the strongest part of the site. Leave it as-is.
- **Contact section** — perfect.
- **Design and layout** — working well. Clean, professional, appropriate.
- **Engagement section structure** — Research & Advisory list is good. Just remove Open-Source Models and fix the Talks & Media items as noted above.
