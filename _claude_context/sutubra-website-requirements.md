# Sutubra Website — Build Instructions

Read `sutubra-website-brief.md` first. It tells you who Cameron is, what he does, and why people hire him.

Your job: turn that into a website that makes a utility planner, government staffer, or RTO analyst pick up the phone.

## Study these sites before you start

Fetch and read these. They nail the tone, structure, or positioning we're after.

- **EnviroEconomics** — https://www.enviroeconomics.org/home — Small Canadian practice, practitioner-driven. Study their structure: how expertise is framed forward rather than listing past projects. How accomplishments are woven into narrative, not displayed in a trophy case.
- **Brattle Group bios** — https://www.brattle.com/experts/peter-s-fox-penner/ and https://www.brattle.com/experts/kathleen-spees/ — How serious energy consultants present themselves. Dense, third-person, credential-forward.
- **Jesse Jenkins' Princeton page** — https://acee.princeton.edu/people-directory/19694-2/ — Academic but practitioner-relevant. Notice how research and impact are integrated, not segregated.
- **Evolved Energy Research** — https://www.evolved.energy and https://www.evolved.energy/people — Cameron's EER bio is here. Minimal, lets work speak.
- **Current sutubra.ca** — https://sutubra.ca — What exists now. Stale, generic, doesn't reflect Cameron's current credentials or range. This is what we're replacing.

## The most important instruction

**Do not reproduce the brief's structure as website structure.** The brief is organized to help you *understand* Cameron. It has sections, project details, method lists. The website should synthesize that understanding into something cohesive — not mirror the document's organization. Connect the dots. A reader should come away understanding what Cameron does, why it matters, and why he's unusually good at it — without feeling like they just read a CV or a project database.

## Hard constraints

- **No EER client names or proprietary tools.** Cameron is a Principal at EER — that's a credential. Don't name their clients, projects, or tools (EnergyPATHWAYS, RIO, Emporium, etc.).
- **No "we."** Sutubra is one person. That's a feature.
- **No project catalog.** The brief has project details so you understand the work. The website should NOT be a list of past projects. Use specifics as proof points woven into narrative.
- **No generic consulting filler.** No "How We Work" platitudes, no services bullet list, no "Proven Models / Tailored Solutions" sections.
- **No corporate buzzwords.** No "thought leader," "cutting-edge," "leveraging," "innovative solutions," "passionate about," "unlocking value."
- **No unverified claims.** Only include facts from the brief.
- **Bio in third person.** ("Cameron Wade is..." / "His research..."). Landing section can use first person. Never "we."

## Tone

Authoritative and plain-spoken. This is someone whose analysis gets cited in federal policy, whose research appears in Nature Communications and the New York Times, who gets invited to brief Senate staff. The site should match that weight. Dense — every sentence earns its place. Technically precise without being jargon soup. No filler, no softeners, no adjectives doing the work that evidence should do.

---

## Design

Clean, professional, readable. Not flashy, not over-designed. Think authoritative institutional page, not startup. Site runs on GitHub Pages. Cameron maintains it directly, so keep it simple to update.

## You have creative freedom

The brief gives you the raw material. The reference sites show you the standard. The constraints above are the guardrails. Within those — structure it, frame it, design it however serves the goal best. Build something that makes someone think "I need to talk to this person."
